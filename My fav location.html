     <h2 style="color:gold;">Dubai,UAE</h2>
     <p style="color:gold;">Dubai is one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE<br>
        It is essentially a desert city with superb infrastructure<br>
        Dubai makes a great short break for shopping, partying, sunbathing, fine dining and sporting events<br>
        The city is rather like an independent city-state and is the most modern and progressive emirate in the UAE<br></p>
